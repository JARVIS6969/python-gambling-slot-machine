# 🎰 Python Slot Machine

## Overview
This is a simple Python slot machine game created as my first semester project.  
The game allows the user to place bets, spin three random symbols, and win or lose based on the result.  
It’s a console-based project made using basic Python logic and the `random` module.

## Features
- Randomized spins with different symbols    
- Betting and balance system  
- Win multiplier for different symbols  
- User input validation  
- Simple and clear console output

## How to Play
1. The game starts with a balance of ₹1000.  
2. Enter your bet amount.  
3. The slot spins and shows three random symbols.  
4. If all three symbols match, you win based on the symbol type:
   - ⚪️ → 2x your bet  
   - ⬜️ → 3x your bet  
   - 🤍 → 5x your bet  
   - 💎 → 10x your bet  
5. If symbols don’t match, you lose your bet.  
6. You can continue playing until you choose to stop or run out of balance.
